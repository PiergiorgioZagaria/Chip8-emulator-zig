* A chip8 emulator (interpreter) written in zig
** Notes
The sound may not be well implemented, I ported it from another emulator
At the moment it can render using a window with SDL or to the terminal (only kitty and other terminals that implement its keyboard protocol) using notcurses
Tested with zig version 0.9.0-dev.1551+8346e011c and notcurses version 2.4.7-1
** Usage
Build using =zig build -Drelease-fast= or without release fast, than run =./zig-out/bin/emu <PATH TO ROM>=
