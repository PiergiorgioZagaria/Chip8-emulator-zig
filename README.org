* A chip8 emulator (interpreter) written in zig
** Usage
Build using =zig build -Drelease-fast= or without release fast, than run =./zig-out/bin/emu <PATH TO ROM>=

** TODOS
# - [ ] Input for ncurses, impossible as it requires either X11 to be working (which means it would not work on wayland, or I would need to study how it works just for this project, which is not worth it), or root privileges (to read from /dev)
# - [ ] The emulator is too fast? The screen flickers? Is it supposed to do that?
- [ ] Add some Images or gifs to showcase the project
- [X] Sound
- [X] All opcodes working
